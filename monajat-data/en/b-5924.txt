None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, the Alone Who has no
partners, to Him belongs Dominion and to Him belong all the Praises,
and He has power over all things (i.e. Omnipotent) ***** If one says
it one−hundred times in one day one will get the reward of manumitting
ten slaves, and one−hundred good deeds will be written in his account,
and one−hundred bad deeds will be wiped off or erased from his account
and on that day he will be protected from the morning till evening
from Satan and nobody will be superior to him except one who has done
more than that which he has done
