O Allah! I seek refuge with You from laziness and geriatric old age,
from all kinds of sins and from being in debt; from the affliction of
the grave and from the punishment of the grave and from the affliction
of the Fire and from the punishment of the Fire and from the evil of
the affliction of wealth; and I seek refuge with You from the
affliction of poverty and I seek refuge with You from the affliction
of Al−Mesiah Ad−Dajjal O Allah! Wash away my sins with the water of
snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from all the sins as a white
garment is cleansed from the filth and let there be a long distance
between me and my sins, as You made East and West far from each other
