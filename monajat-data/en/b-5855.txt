None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and He has no partner in
Lordship or in worship or in the Names and the Qualities, and for Him
is the Kingdom and all the praises are for Him and He is omnipotent. O
Allah! Nobody can hold back what you give and nobody can give what You
hold back. Hard (efforts by anyone for anything cannot benefit one
against Your Will)
